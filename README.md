Chlorophyll is the main souce of carbon sink. From 2015 to 2020, day by day chlorophyll level is decreasing. We want to show the world that chlorophyll level is drowning & for this capacity of worldâ€™s carbon sinking level is decreasing. We have taken input from from NASA WORLDVIEW. We have added Aqua/MODIS, Terra/MODIS, Soumi NPP/VIIRS layer to see chlorophyll data.

 Then we analyzed it via MATLAB. We have separated images into 5 layers & then calculated the changes of layers over the years. We have analyzed  data of chlorophyll from August 2015 to September 2020.  Here Red level means here chlorophyll level is lowest & green level means in that region chlorophyll level is the highest.

To mesaurement inter city and intracity carbon footprint, this device is created. It will measure intensity of co2 and methene in ppm and record the value along with coordinate.

At first you need to open proteus file. Here we have developed our circuit. With MQ4 we will measure ammount of methane in ppm. We need to use MQ135 to measure the ammount of CO2, but this MQ135 or K30 which are used in measuring CO2 is not available for proteus. So in proteus we have built circuit for MQ7 which is used in measuring CO. The circuit is same, just in real world we need to replace MQ7 with MQ-135.

We have deveoped code for this circuit in arduino assuming MQ135 used. We have also added GPS & SD card to get location & to store information. We need many library functions which are attached with this folder.

Proteus library function need to put on the instruent to run the siulation & to run code in arduino library function need to add in libray
